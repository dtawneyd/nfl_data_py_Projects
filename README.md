# nfl_data_py_Projects
Data analytic projects using nfl_data_py package
For this repository, I wanted to work with the Python package nfl_data_py and explore the vast number of data points that it offers, and get some practice with data analytics, data visualization, and data modeling. Here I will simply upload different 'projects' that I work on and within each file, there will be a more in-depth ReadMe/walkthrough of my thought process.
